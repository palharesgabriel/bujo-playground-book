 # About me
 
 My name is Gabriel, I'm 21 years old and I'm a student of Computer Engineering. Several people around me have already suffered or suffer from mental health problems, one of them is my girlfriend. That's why I started several research in the area of psychological and behavioral disorders, looking for ways to intervene with my knowledge as a developer. I chose to be an iOS developer to be able to create new things and use all the knowledge gained to help people, what good is it to be good at something if that goodness does not reach real people with real problems? My goal with this playground was to show people the importance of knowing yourself and never close your eyes to small achievements, remember that the details matter a lot! Soon I will have news on the App Store in the area of mental health ðŸ˜† I hope to help as many people as I can.
