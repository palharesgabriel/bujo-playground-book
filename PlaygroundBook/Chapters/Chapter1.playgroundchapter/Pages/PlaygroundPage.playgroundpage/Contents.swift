 # Bullet Journal: Taking care of your mental health
 
Hi, how are you? Have you ever stopped to think about how is your mental health? I created this playground to share some methods developed by users of Bullet Journal (I'll tell you below what is this) in order to give due attention to this topic. Psychological and behavioral disorders are getting more and more common, especially among young people.
 
 Anxiety and stress, for example, are directly related to the condition of life imposed by the society in which we live. Unfortunately many people still find it difficult to take over their condition and seek professional treatment. So I'm excited to share with you a way to open up to your mental health!
 
Studies in the field of psychology show that establishing a routine with goals and having a moment of self knowledge on a daily basis is a simple way to take care of your mental health. The *BuJo* (Bullet Journal cute nickname) is a method of organization created by designer  Ryder Carroll which, in addition to its main function, has been used to organize the feelings and thoughts of people with mental health problems.
 
 Let's get to know some elements of the BuJo that can improve your quality of life!

The bullet journal is very customizable, so this list of bullets can be variable, and you can define the ones that work best in your life.  The rapid logging strategy can be a great help in organizing your daily goals!
 
Let's practice, you can drag the bullets and set some goals for your day, use your creativity!
 
 - Note:
 When you add a text you can hold to drag it and drop it into another position.
