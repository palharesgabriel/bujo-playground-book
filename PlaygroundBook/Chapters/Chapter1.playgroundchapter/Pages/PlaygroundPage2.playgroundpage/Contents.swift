 ### The Habit Tracker
 
 The habit tracker is a really cool tool, it can give you an overview of the month and allows you to map your behavior. It is a way for you to measure what you did that made you feel good and the other way around.
 
 You can divide your tracker into physical sensations (headache, appetite, insomnia), good and bad behaviors (hours of sleep, I drank alcohol, I took the pills, I spent more than 1 hour on Netflix), and even one for your mood.
 
 One of the things that the habit tracker provides is self knowledge, as has been said previously, self-knowledge is very important to overcome any problem in life. It can be a first step in recognizing your condition, and from there seeking professional help in a more open way.

 All you need to do is use the calendar related to each habit and mark every day of the current month that you performed that particular activity. Time to try! Drag and drop the calendars to make some examples using some predefined habits.
 
 - Note:
 Hold and drag to add the calendars to the canvas.
