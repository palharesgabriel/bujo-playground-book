 # Bullet journal: Tools to fight anxiety and depression
 ### The Gratitude Log
 
 This is an old friend of BuJo. Gratitude log is a page where you write down all the things you are grateful for every day. It's a simple way for you to realize that there is something good going on every day, no matter how bad things are going. You can set it up as the monthly log: write the days of the month one below the other and your gratitude of the day next to the respective date.
 
 It is very important to make these records daily, with quick interactions in your journal you can do a lot for your mental health. This is my favorite component, it pleases me to be grateful for the little things. Do not you think the little achievements make us stronger?
 
 I hope you enjoyed the experience üòÅ Bullet Journal is a great tool for:
 * Organize your life
 * Follow the past
 * Organize the present
 * Plan the future.
 
 Do not forget to make your own BuJo, then you tell me it worked out üòå
